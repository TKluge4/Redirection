# Redirection

PHP/JavaScript [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/johngodley/redirection.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/johngodley/redirection)

Redirection is a WordPress plugin to manage 301 redirections, keep track of 404 errors, and generally tidy up any loose ends your site may have. This is particularly useful if you are migrating pages from an old website, or are changing the directory of your WordPress installation.

Note: this is the current 'trunk' version of Redirection. It may be newer than what is in the WordPress.org plugin repository, and should be considered experimental.

## Installation
Redirection can be installed by visiting the WordPress.org plugin page:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/

## Customisation

Redirection provides a large set of WordPress action and filter hooks that can be used to extend or customise the plugin. These can found on the [Redirection Hooks](https://redirection.me/developer/wordpress-hooks/) page.

### Permissions

Access to the Redirection admin interface is given to users who can `manage_options`. You can modify this with permission filters, described on the [Redirection permissions](https://redirection.me/developer/permissions/) page.

## Building

Redirection is mostly a PHP plugin, but does contain files that need to be built. For this you'll need Gulp, Node, and Yarn installed. Install required modules with:

`yarn install`

### Language files

`gulp pot` - Updates language files

### React

Some parts of the UI are React and can be built with:

`yarn build`

To use in development mode then set `REDIRECTION_DEV_MODE` to true in PHP, and run:

`yarn start`

This will start Webpack in hot-reload mode, and you can make changes to JS files and have them auto-loaded.

### Releasing

Finally, to produce a release copy:

`gulp plugin`

## Support

Please raise any bug reports or enhancement requests here. Pull requests are always welcome.
